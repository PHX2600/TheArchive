February 2005 Meeting History by, XlogicX
-----------------------------------------
This was a very well attended meeting. No real theme this time either, but many
people brought much gear. Iamtheevil1 brought some phreaking toys, including a
cool old handset with alligator clips. Rax brought along a Mac mini and booted
it up for us to use. RetroTech brought his old radio to do an antenna mod right
at the meeting. In the circle I was sitting in, talk ranged mostly around
programming (Java and C# predominately). I also brought along the locks (8 of
them) and picks since Surface_Tension wanted to learn, and that he did, he
worked his way up to the master lock, along with some other hackers. Most of the
lock picking was done when we went to Nicks' Pizza...Pizza and lock picking.

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 20

August 2005 Meeting History by, XlogicX
========================================
Our last meeting at Borders. ZEROcool brought his Xbox, we didn't get the chance
to softmod it due to Nicks not having the remote for their TV. Zapperlink
brought his PSP with some more "updates" straight outa Japan. Rax brought hacker
stickers in several languages. There was talk about defcon. We traveled over to
Nicks pizza early. Jargon had a presentation on gambling. We tripped out w/3D
glasses and an oldskool laptop. IamtheEvil1 rode on the mechanical horse for his
B-day. What was left of us headed over to Counter Culture to chill for a little
longer. What was left of that crowd (Zapperlink and I) went to IHOP.

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 20-25

September 2009 Meeting History by, PHLAK
----------------------------------------
September turned out to be quite a large meeting. Ugly was working on
attaching a new power connector to a motherboard and helped Rax
diagnose a problem with his monitors. The main focus of this meeting
was on Penguins presentation on creating your own PCB boards via acid
etching. Also, some ladies curbed their truck after attempting to get
several members to sign a petition for legalization of marijuana
(yeah, they were probably high). We got some lulz. [nggallery id=36]

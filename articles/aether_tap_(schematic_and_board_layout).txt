Aether Tap (Schematic and Board Layout)
=======================================
Posted by, Penguin on 2010-02-22 16:51:45

I have finalized a Board layout and schematic, I ended up going with a double
sided board since I was unable to route the entire board on a single plane.

The advantage of a double sided PCB for those who arenâ€™t aware is that there
is copper clad on both sides of the board as opposed to a single sided board
which has copper only on one side.

This allows us to run a signal from one side of the board to the other using a
"via", a small conductor which gives us one extra dimension of flexibility in
our design, one extra layer in 3d space to route our signals.

Consider this puzzle [1] as a simpler example of the same problem (good luck).

The file below contains the most recent Eagle schematic and board layout as well
as several helpful part libraries and the design rules I used.

Simon on the OOPIC
==================

This is one of my favorite microcontrollers. It can be programmed in C++, Java,
and BASIC. I started programming it in C++, but later switched to BASIC since
there was more support for it. I took this micro to a meeting and had a game
programmed I programmed on it. It was a memory game based on Simon. The
controller has 3 small LEDs, and 3 push buttons right under them, so I figured a
game like Simon would be a natural thing to do.

Here is a picture of the microcontroller that Slip took with his phone (Slip
transfered the picture to Dual_Parallel, so I got the picture from
www.oldskoolphreak.com [1]).

I also included the code that I used to program the micro:

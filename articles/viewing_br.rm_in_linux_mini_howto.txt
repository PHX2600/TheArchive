Viewing br.rm in Linux Mini - HOWTO
===================================
Posted by, Feend on 2008-08-28 23:53:48

Like other listeners of rfa I too wanted to view the binary revolution unveiling
video (www.oldskoolphreak.com/video/br.rm [1]) but was horrified that I could
not even after downloading the RealPlayer client
(http://forms.real.com/real/player/unix/unix.html?src=052703realhome_1_1 [2]).
After many hours of therapy I am now able to help those who may also be
suffering from this condition.

Using Realplayer8 to view br.rm
1. Follow the RealPlayer link above
2. Fill in the information (false info is fine)
3. At the "Select OS" drop down menu choose Linux 2.x (libc6 i386)
4. Save to your desired directory (I used ~)
5. chmod u+x rp8_linux20_libc6_i386_cs2.bin
6. ./rp8_linux20_libc6_i386_cs2.bin
7. Return back to the RealPlayer link provided at the top of the mini-HOWTO
8. You will see a "Free RealVideo 9 codec upgrade package" link...follow it
9. Download rv9_libc6_i386_cs2.tgz
10. Rename rv9_libc6_i386_cs2.tgz to rv9_libc6_i386_cs2.tar
11. tar -xvf rv9_libc6_i386_cs2.tar
12. mv /rv9/codecs/rv40.so.6.0 /RealPlayer8/Codecs/
13. mv /rv9/codecs/drv4.so.6.0 /RealPlayer8/Codecs/
14.
15. Open br.rm
16. Enjoy

Using Xine to view br.rm

[Method 1]
1. Follow the above directions to step 13
    -If you chose to install RealPlayer to /usr/local/RealPlayer8/
     Xine will find the codecs for you
    -Or if you chose to install RealPlayer to /opt/RealPlayer8/
     Xine will find the codecs for you
2. Run Xine
3. Open br.rm
4. Enjoy

[Method 2]
1. Follow the above directions to step 13
2. Edit ~/.xine/config
3. Change the line codec.real_codecs_path:
4. Run Xine
5. Open br.rm
6. Enjoy

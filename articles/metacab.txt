Metacab is a cabinet file that contains Netcat, Nmap, VNC and other remote
administration utilities that need only a Windows command shell, cmd.exe, to
install and use. Install and uninstall scripts are included, and work is being
completed on antivirus evasion.

it would be awesome to have these never hit disk and use reflective DLL
injection or such, like the VNC metasploit paylod already does, but i dont know
if it possible.

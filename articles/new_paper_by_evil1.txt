Yessir, I busted my ass hump to pump out another paper. 40 pages of ownage,
awesome, and win. 

Download it HERE [1]. 

The paper covers web shells in PHP, ASP, JSP, Coldfusion, and Perl as well as
hacking techniques for auditing each language (brief, but to the point). 

If you have any questions about the paper, email me. Contact info on the site /
in the paper. 

::Edit:: now in pdf form instead of doc.

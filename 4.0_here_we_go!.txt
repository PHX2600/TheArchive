4.0 here we go! by, XlogicX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just launched version 4.0 of the PHX2600 layout. I wanted to get this
out before Defcon, so tonight was the night. More information on the
style and other back end changes to come. If there are any bugs or
problems noticed, please email me at phlak@phx2600.org.

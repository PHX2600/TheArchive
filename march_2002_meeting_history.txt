March 2002 Meeting History by, Penguin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Fantasy in Divx, a Compaq 286 laptop, and a new project Hacking
Gameworks. Rax, Kondor, and myself went wardriving, or wilding as Rax
likes to call it, one week after the meeting. We found a couple of
networks, but didn't get an IP. We'll talk about our zany antics in
the March 20 episode of Radio FreeK America, and possibly publish the
locations and SSIDs we find. -dual ATTENDANCE COUNT: N/A

March 2002 Meeting History
==========================
Posted by, XlogicX on 2002-03-01 20:11:15

Final Fantasy in Divx, a Compaq 286 laptop, and a new project Hacking Gameworks.
Rax, Kondor, and myself went wardriving, or wilding as Rax likes to call it, one
week after the meeting. We found a couple of networks, but didn't get an IP.
We'll talk about our zany antics in the March 20 episode of Radio FreeK America,
and possibly publish the locations and SSIDs we find.

February 2010 Meeting History by, PHLAK
========================================
This meeting was a particularly large meeting. Most "active" members were there
at some point throughout the night and several of us overflowed outside. AltF4
gave his advanced presentation on cryptography, Zapperlink brought an Intel I7
powered laptop and an Atom powered IP phone, Rax gave away a couple of shirts (I
got the Android one, woohoo!) and other miscellaneous conversations went on as
well.

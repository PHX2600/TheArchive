April 2005 Meeting History by, XlogicX
--------------------------------------
RetroTech brought his Tandy laptop, it had DOS 3.3 and only 7 files on the
"storage" space (50K worth). The lappy boots up in less than 5 seconds though,
the video should be up on the April 2005 pictures page. We fixed the power
adapter by soldering it back together. I tried a floppy drive hardware hack, but
screwed up, now retro has no floppy...sorry retro. Zapperlink brought a PSP and
showed us a browser hack for it. Sgnome brought a huge antenna, there should be
pictures of it. Nak and his buddies brought a ham radio. Also, greyarea was
there, cool he could make it this time. Oh yeah, Zapperlinks daughter (Trinity)
tried out picking locks...she's not even 2 yet!...again, pictures on the picture
section :)

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 22

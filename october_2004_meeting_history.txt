October 2004 Meeting History by, XlogicX
=========================================
Special Agent Tom Liffiton was present this time, it made for a more interesting
meeting. We discussed some P.A.T.R.I.O.T ACT issues with him; predominantly the
"library" one. He also discussed the priorities of the FBI, a few of them not
being RIAA and MPAA. There was also some brief discussion on the Bernie S. and
Kevin Mitnick cases. It was also interesting to hear that Special Agent Thomas
Liffiton is a listener to BinRev and RFA; he inquired about HPR. It's nice that
there isn't completely the "us vs. them" mentality, and the reality is true
sometimes too. There were a couple of new faces to this meeting, including my
good friend Medicine Soup.

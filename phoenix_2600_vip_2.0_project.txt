Phoenix 2600 VIP 2.0 Project by, XlogicX
----------------------------------------
ASSIGNMENT:

Step 1: Sign up for VIP cards (use fake info) in the following 4 stores:
Albertsons
Frys
Safeway
Bashas

Step 2: When you go to the store, try using a VIP card for the wrong store:
Example: go to Frys and use your Safeway club card.

Step 3: Report to the forums. Please report the what store the vip card is
supposed to be for, the first 6 digits of the barcode, what store you tried it
on, and if it worked or not.

Step 4: Goto Step 2 Until research is done

Whoever submits their results on the forums will be listed below as members of
this project. Please don't make stuff up either, we want a working
product...well I do atleast. Don't worry about being secretive with this. I
sometimes prefer going to normal checkout (not self-checkout). I just say "hey,
I'm curious, but could you see if this VIP card works." Or just tell them your
doing a research project for school. Honestly, with most of them, you don't even
have to give them a story. But then again, those of you that have used the first
generation VIP card know that. I will have a Open Office Calc file with the
results in progress of the data collected below.

--------------------------------

PROTOTYPES:

VIP 2.0 Version 1 (This one works, but it's two codes)

VIP 2.0 Version 2 (After testing, this one is not consistant at Albertsons)

VIP 2.0 Version 3 (Testing; failed at Albertson again, turns out the checksum
was bad): The idea of this one is to cover up one of the colored circles with a
thumb or finger. If covering green doesn't work at albertsons, cover the blue,
this should work in thoery...hence the testing.

VIP 2.0 Version 4 (Testing): Same idea as version 3.

VIP 2.0 Version 5 (Testing): A legit looking version.

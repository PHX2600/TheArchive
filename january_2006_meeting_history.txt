Etherape and Ethereal were played around with. Nak updated some firmware for a
remote router, we like doing favors. Penguin got to browsing 4chan and we came
across several crazy pics and animations including Two Crazy Robots. Penguin
brought his Toshiba tablet running windows 95 after an upgrade from 3.1.

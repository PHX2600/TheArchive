DFC -- Getting Started by, Zapperlink
-------------------------------------
For those of you who enjoy good fun challenges the Digital Forensic
Challenge (http://www.dc3.mil/2009_challenge/ [1]) is probably
something you have already heard of. Hosted by the Department of
Defense (http://www.defenselink.mil/ [2]) and sponsored by SANS
(http://www.sans.org/ [3]) it allows competitors to de-tangle the
weave of an event using digital forensics. What I hope to cover in
this article is a jump start method for you to keep in mind when you
want to join an event like this.

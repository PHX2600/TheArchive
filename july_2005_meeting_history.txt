July 2005 Meeting History by, Penguin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We met in the back of Borders this time (we were on the schedule!).
LosT brought his soldering station and some embedded network
components to solder together, so we had a little soldering workshop.
People that didn't know how to solder, and wanted to know, knew by the
time they left. We did some general talking about embedded systems and
talked about Make magazine a little. There was talk about defcon 13.
We later went to Nicks, surprisingly enough, I think the group got
bigger when we met there. While at Nicks, Nak busted out his ham gear
and evil1 and Nak were talking to random people the could find through
the waves. We had some talk about the stumble upon toolbar. Lots of
creative discussion about barcodes (later in the night). After a
while, Nak came back around and we had some pre-4th of July
celebrations with a block of sodium. Maybe next time: Soap in a
microwave }:> 

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 15-20+

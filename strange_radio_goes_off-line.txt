Strange Radio Goes Off-line by, Terrordrone
============================================
The call sign UBV 76 out of 
Russia on the short wave frequency 4625Â kHz is pretty well known among the
radio community and it has apparently gone off-line. No one really knows what it
was used if anything at all. Since around 1982 it has been transmitting and
buzzing tone 25 times a minute 24 hours a day.As heard here. [1]
To even add to the strange transmission 3 times during the 25 plus years voice
transmission has been heard in Russian one translates to this "75-59-75-59.
39-52-53-58. 5-5-2-5.
Konstantin-1-9-0-9-0-8-9-8-Tatiana-Oksana-Anna-Elena-Pavel-Schuka. Konstantin
8-4. 9-7-5-5-9-Tatiana. Anna Larisa Uliyana-9-4-1-4-3-4-8."
Wikipedia has a good article about this stations here. [2]
I have heard from other radio nerds that the have received the buzz tones again
from this station but I have not been able to again if any other radios geeks
out there do manage to get it please try to record it and let me know.

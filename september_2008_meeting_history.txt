September 2008 Meeting History by, XlogicX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was a decently sized meeting. Much lock picking went on as is the
norm. There was some discussion of cable modem hacking. Taryn and
Zaphraud brought their baby as usual, and he seemed to get much
attention. Jargon introduced us to pr0ndar.com, one of his random
websites. Twitter was lightly talked about. ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 25

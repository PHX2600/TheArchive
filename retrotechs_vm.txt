RetroTechs VM by, RetroTech
---------------------------
This is a screenshot from a project that RetroTech worked on. It was some
impressive software written in Java. What he wrote was a virtual machine of a
very simple hardware type and operating language. The instructions that this
virtual machine had were: increment, decrement, load registers, load addresses,
branch on zero or branch on not zero. This sounds like it was a very worthy
experiment. I personally give him props for doing this in a cumbersome language
such as Java. His personal website can be found at

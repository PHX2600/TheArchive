October 2005 Meeting History by, Penguin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This meeting took place at UAT. Nak and MadManX brought their
cardreader devices and got them working at the meeting. Somebody else
brought some embeded gear that they were trying to get to work. I
brought my basic stamp with a combo blue/red/silver box programmed
into it. After the meeting a few of us (Legitimate_User, Sgnome,
Empty, and I) went to Subculture cafe to get something to eat. 

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 25-30

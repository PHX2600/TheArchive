December 2004 Meeting History by, XlogicX
==========================================
It seems the theme of this meeting was barcodes. I brought in about 30
"universal" VIP cards that have a VIP code for 3 different grocery stores, the
other barcode is an "easter egg." RAX brought his scanner and a laptop equip
with some java software that can decode the 2d barcode on the back of a drivers
ID, so we played with that. dec33var brought a few 1d barcode scanners with him.
Zapperlink had some great info on Krypto. Also rhy0t brought some lock picks and
a couple locks, we tried picking them for a while, she was the only one to get
both locks, a few of us got the easier master(?)lock (I got it, yay me).

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 12-15

March 2005 Meeting History
==========================
Posted by, XlogicX on 2005-03-04 20:13:30

Fun meeting, probably the most disorganized yet too; we never really formed one
big table together like we usually do. Rax brought knoppix through the looking
glass edition (has it worked on anyones box yet?). I took my toasted netgear
router, and I also brought some security screwdriver bits. Lockpicking was in
fashion again, I guess this is just a phx2600 tradition; some hackers like
dumpster diving, some hackers like phreaking, some hackers like trains for some
reason...we still like all of that, but we really like picking locks.

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 15

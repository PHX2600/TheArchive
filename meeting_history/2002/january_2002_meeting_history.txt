You owe it to yourself to check out the music of some 2600 attendees. Hardwire
and Fred from Ikonoklast came the Jan meeting. John B. from BLESSEDBETHYNAME
came to the Dec meeting. Get your fix of industrial/hardcore/metal/tech at the
links above. Also, shout outs to first timers Liberty and slipNaway.

Sunday after the meeting, I went to park-n-swap (the big one at the dog track)
and picked up some great stuff. I got a 33.6 external modem for $4, a cat-5
cable for 50 cents, and a couple of caller ID boxes for a few bucks. One box, a
US West 99-memory model, was full of interesting numbers.

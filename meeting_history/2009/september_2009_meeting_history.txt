September 2009 Meeting History
==============================

September turned out to be quite a large meeting. Ugly was working on attaching
a new power connector to a motherboard and helped Rax diagnose a problem with
his monitors. The main focus of this meeting was on Penguins presentation on
creating your own PCB boards via acid etching. Also, some ladies curbed their
truck after attempting to get several members to sign a petition for
legalization of marijuana (yeah, they were probably high). We got some lulz.

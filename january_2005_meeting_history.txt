January 2005 Meeting History by, XlogicX
=========================================
There was no real theme to this meeting. Rhy0t got me back into lock picking
from last months meeting, so I brought 5 locks and a couple sets of picks. Many
people at the meeting were able to pick up the skill in practically no time.
iamtheevil1 whipped out one of those random number generating authentication
devices, so that was cool. I also talked about a way to get around Napster, with
it's disadvantages though. Rocket from Interz0ne attended this meeting (correct
me if I got the handle spelled wrong), he seems to drop by once a year.
Afterwords, a lot of us went over to Nicks 24/7 pizza like usual.

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 10-11

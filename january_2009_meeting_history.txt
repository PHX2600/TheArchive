January 2009 Meeting History by, PHLAK
--------------------------------------
January was a small meeting. It started late and seemed to end early.
Speculation is that people were still busy/out of town from the holidays. Logic
was there for a bit, but disappeared early.

Thanks to JPerridew for the meeting pics.

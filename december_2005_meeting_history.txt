December 2005 Meeting History by, XlogicX
-----------------------------------------
This meeting was a little larger than the last. The meeting was pretty much a
card printing/writing/reading extravaganza. l3gitimateuser and associates
brought all kinds of goodies. They brought a smart chip reader, a Fargo card
printer, and a mag strip writer/reader. We were able to read a phoenix metro bus
card, and find the expiration date in the data. One could change this date and
re-enable a card with a writer of such, it doesn't appear that our bus system
employs a checksum system, not that we would know or anything :). We later
headed over to get something to eat (Mexican food this time).

ATTENDANCE COUNT: 15-20

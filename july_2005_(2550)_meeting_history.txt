July 2005 (2550) Meeting History by, Penguin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2600 hangout (2550 meeting)- We met at nicks pizza. Some gear brought
was a cable card, some shims, and a nice new bootable distro of WHAX.
WHAX didn't work to well on a sony laptop though. We "picked" a combo
lock with the shim. Later on Ugly and I went wardriving to the Sonic
Drive-ins, no luck though.

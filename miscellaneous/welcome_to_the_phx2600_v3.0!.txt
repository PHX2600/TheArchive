Welcome to the PHX2600 v3.0!

Once again I have been hard at work to bring to you this feature filled website.
This site has been lightly tested during the design phase, but like any human
being, I am susceptible to making mistakes. If you notice any spelling, design,
or other flaws with this site, or would like to contact me, please do so here
[1] or in the forums.

Some of you may be asking, what does this new site add? Well, this site was
built from the ground up to utilize WordPress, a state-of-the-art publishing
platform, or blog. With WordPress, pages are now easily editable, and once
tedious tasks (like updating the Meeting History) are now a whole lot simpler
and straight forward. Also, by utilizing WordPress, we can bring the website
ever closer to home by allowing each and every one of you contribute by being an
author and publishing in our Blog. If you would like to write an article, please
sign up for an account, then contact either XlogicX or myself, and we will
promote up your clearance level to "Author" or whatever we see fit.

Once again, if you have any questions or concerns about the site, WordPress, the
Forums or you just wanted to know what I had for lunch, please feel free to
contact me [2] or post your questions in the forums.

Thanks go out to XlogicX for providing the server and setting up the databases,
and to all of you for your support and participation in PHX2600.

============================
Posted by, XlogicX on 2006-10-07 17:46:52

Lots of new people, and even old people; Dual and Kondor return. AgentOrange has
presentation on non-SQL database hacking with PHP. Ugly brings a Jacob's ladder.
XlogicX brings a toy: GPS and LCD modules connected to a Basic Stamp 2e
processor. WTF item for this month was brought by NAK, it was a bee feeder, I
forget who guessed it, and if it was even a legitimate guess (many clues were
given).

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 25

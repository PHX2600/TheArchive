December 2003 Meeting History by, XlogicX
-----------------------------------------
Dual_Parallel did a presentation titled "Building Boxes on a Barrio Budget."
There was some really cool hardware included in the presentation and it went
over really well. I brought my stun glove and used some metal to arc the
contacts to show the gloves destructive ends.

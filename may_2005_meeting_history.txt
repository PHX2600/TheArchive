------------------------------------
Retro brought a 286 lappy and hot glued some shinny stuff to it. Rax brought a
mac with Tiger. Nak brought his ham gear and used the autopatch method to call
my cell. LosT brought a bunch of embedded web server gear. Zaphraud brought his
cantenna, made from a pringles can. I handed out a few vip 2.0 prototypes for
people to test. After that, half of us went the Nicks Pizza and had a bite to
eat.

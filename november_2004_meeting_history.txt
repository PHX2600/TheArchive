November 2004 Meeting History by, Penguin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was a good deal of gear that came to this meeting. I brought the
Zenith 286 laptop with a snazzy monochrome screen saver programmed by
Medicine_Soup. Rax brought an optical mouse (to gut out) and a cuecat.
ArchAngel brought a bunch of tone dialers and handed them out.
RetroTech brought some old software on floppies for the laptop. I also
brought my OOPIC again. There was a lot of talk on retro computing and
some talk of urban exploration (we thought about looking around the
abandoned restaurant a few shops down, but that never materialized).
After that, most of us cruised over to Nicks Pizza and got a bite to
eat...well, we also tried screwing with their pay phone too
(602-240-9970). 

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 15

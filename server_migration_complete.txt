Server Migration Complete by, PHLAK
====================================
The server move went down fairly smoothly. There were a few lingering problems I
came across this morning, but resolved those promptly.

Some users may still not be able to access the site because of the 24 hour TTL
GoDaddy had on the DNS records. Aside from that, everything should be working
100% now.

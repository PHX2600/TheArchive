Embeded Ethernet Project Web Log by, Penguin
--------------------------------------------
So I guess I have access to publish posts on this front page, that's pretty
awesome. I'm sure I wont ever abuse this.

Anyway just wanted to say I have setup a web-log to document my embedded
Ethernet project, I'm already half way done with the project but I just started
the web log so I'm sort of playing catch up with my posts.

I'm going to do my best to make one post per day until I'm caught up and then
ill post as needed to document the project.

I may post other things on it as well but mostly the site is just for
documentation purposes.

Also its worth mentioning for those who have been waiting on me to publish
instructions on how to do the toner transfer etching that I will finally be
documenting that as part of this project.

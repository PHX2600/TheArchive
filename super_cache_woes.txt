Super Cache Woes by, PHLAK
--------------------------
Some of you may have noticed that the front page wasn't changing,
specifically the posts and the next meeting date. I'm fairly certain
this was due to Super Cache being out of date. I have since updated
Super Cache to the latest version and cleared the cache. I will
monitor the front page for the next couple of days and make sure that
this has resolved the problem.

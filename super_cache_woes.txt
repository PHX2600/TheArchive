Super Cache Woes
================

Some of you may have noticed that the front page wasn't changing, specifically
the posts and the next meeting date. I'm fairly certain this was due to Super
Cache being out of date. I have since updated Super Cache to the latest version
and cleared the cache. I will monitor the front page for the next couple of days
and make sure that this has resolved the problem.

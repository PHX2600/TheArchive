June 2005 Meeting History by, Penguin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are now getting to big for the Borders coffee shop; they want a
group our size to be scheduled. So, we are going to get on the
schedule. In this meeting we had a lot of gear donated to Zapperlink
for a group community project: Making a emulated gaming system for a
daycare. Rax did a presentation on a replacement OS for LinkSys
WAP/Router. ZEROcool brought an ipod with Linux dual booted on it (it
didn't have sound support though, funny irony). Colin brought a super
rugged lappy. 

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 25+

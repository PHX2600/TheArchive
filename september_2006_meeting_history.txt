September 2006 Meeting History by, XlogicX
------------------------------------------
Ryh0t comes back to one of our meetings, with daughter. XlogicX has presentation
on using a sound card to make a low frequency 0-scope/data capture device. WTF
for this month was finding out what signal the Basic Stamp was putting out. Nak
found that it was Morse code for phx2600.

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 25

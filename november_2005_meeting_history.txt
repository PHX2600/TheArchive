November 2005 Meeting History by, XlogicX
==========================================
This was a much smaller 2600 meeting. We were moved to a different room at UAT.
Zapperlink brought his PSP and talked about some of the cool unconventional
things that could be done with it. Zap also brought an Intel goodie. Rax brought
a live Project Looking glass, but the computer at UAT wouldn't boot it. Dual
Parallel brought some phone numbers. I did another demo of the blue/red/silver
box. We collectively made a bunch of stupid jokes at the expense of the movie
Hackers, it may have something to do with the fact that there is a rave coming
up using the name hackers. After the meeting, most of us headed to YC's to get
something to eat, revelations were had by most. Then about half of the group
headed to Counter Culture for a little while.

ATTENDANCE COUNT: 10-12

September 2004 Meeting History by, XlogicX
------------------------------------------
Special Agent Tom Liffiton was supposed to show up again, but again,
didn't. That's ok though, he's probably very busy. We confronted the
suspicious "FED" guy that is always there with a notebook. He says
he's writing a Sci-Fi...yeah, mmkay. 

ATTENDANCE COUNT: ABOUT 12

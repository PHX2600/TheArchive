August 2006 Meeting History by, RetroTech
==========================================
Some of the highlights were: Everyone brainstorming how to get software working
on Ugly's laptop which had the net install (or was it just the net installer) of
debian. As well as reteo going through all frustration of trying different
things. Everyone plotting hypothetical ways to kill jargon. Cetain blackhat
activity towards a certain state's certain department's web server by a certain
pair.
